What is your favorite programming language? Why?

I'd say java is my favorite programming language currently because it's not as low level as a language like C and a little more 
strict than python. We've also had to use java in all our data structure and algorithms classes here at VT.\, which has made me 
comfortable with it.


Is your favorite language the one you are also most experienced with? If not, which language are you most experienced with?

It is.
